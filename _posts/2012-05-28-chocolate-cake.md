Can I have that Recipe Chocolate Cake

* 1 pkg of Duncan Hines dark chocolate cake mix
* 1 pkg instant chocolate fudge pudding
* ½ c. water
* ½ c canola oil
* 1 pint sour cream
* 4 eggs
* 12 oz. Semi-sweet chocolate chips

Blend everything but the chocolate chips, then stir them in. In a well-greased bundt pan, bake for one hour at 350. Cool upside down for ten minutes.

Tweaks, because my cake sides stuck to the bundt pan:
Flour the well-greased bundt pan.
Let the cake cool before taking out of the pan – 10 minutes was not enough time.
